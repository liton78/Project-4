<font color="green"><b>Bangladesh</b></font> captain <b>Tamim</b> Iqbal defied a knee injury to <b>score 112</b> and set up a five-wicket victory and a 3-0 one-day international whitewash of <b><i>Zimbabwe on Tuesday</i></b>. The hosts posted 298 in 49.3 overs and the visitors <del>reached</del> <u>302-5 with 12</u> balls to spare at an overcast Harare Sports Club. Tamim missed the one-off Test against Zimbabwe earlier this month because of the injury, but played in all the <b>ODI</b> internationals, saying he could "manage" the pain. <strong>After scoring 20</strong> and being out for a duck in the first two matches, the skipper let loose at the third attempt, scoring at a rate of more than a run a ball to record his 14th <b>ODI</b> century.</p>

	<p><b><i><u>Sri Lanka Friday slapped a one-year international ban on three top cricketers for breaching Covid-19 regulations while on tour in England. The lengthy bans and $50,000 fines were ordered after vice-captain Kusal Mendis, opener Danushka Gunathilaka and wicket-keeper Niroshan Dickwella were seen out in Durham before a one-day international against England. The punishment is the toughest taken by any cricket nation for breaches of the anti-coronavirus bubbles which have now become standard practice in international sport.</u></i></b></p>
